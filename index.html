        	<h2>Hi there, I'm Isaac Friedman.</h2>
	  <p>I'm an outdoorsman, fantasy geek and general tinkerer who loves to code. I am passionate about learning new things, especially skills, both in and out of what we traditionally think of as "tech." 
		I try to do or learn something new every day, and that usually happens at work. I enjoy making things work and understanding why they do (or don't).
		I'm currently a QA Automation Engineer at <a href="https://vettery.com/">Vettery</a>. Before that I worked a Software Engineer, a non-profit administrator, a handyman,
		a calligrapher and more, sometimes at the same time. I believe that work should be challenging and fun, and that any job is worth doing well.
