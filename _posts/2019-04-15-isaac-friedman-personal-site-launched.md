After using github sporadically for a long time, I'm finally exploring features like github pages. Turns out it's extremely easy to start a blog like this one powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). I can write posts and static pages in markdown of whatever flavor I choose. Since the platform is so unobtrusive and markdown makes writing in plain text and site-editing so seamless, I think my next post will be about those various flavors of markdown.
